To run a project launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:

# python3 -m http.server 8000

You also need a development local API server, which is available here: https://github.com/dzulix/mws-restaurant-stage-3

Install project dependancies
# npm i
Install Sails.js globally
# npm i sails -g
Start the server
# node server

You're ready to go!
